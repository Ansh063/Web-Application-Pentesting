1. if the cookie is having httponly flag set to true then this cookie is not accesible by javascript

2. HTTP Header  :
	\r (carriage return) : moves the cursor to the begining of the line 
	\n (line feed) : move the cursor to the next line 
	\r\n : same function as ENTER

3.request-type : is also known as HTTP verb 

4. Accept column in HTTP header : It is used by the browser to specify which documnet type is expected to be returned as a result of request.

5. The Accept-Encoding is similar to accept, but it restrics the content codings that are acceptable in the reponse. content coding are primarily used to allow a document to be compressed or transformed without losing the identity of its media type and without loss of information. 

6. The Cache-Header allow the brower and the server to agree about caching rules. Cached Contents save bandwidth because, in short, they prevent your browser from re-requesting contents that have not changed when the same resource is to be used. 

7. The Server header displays the web server banner 



####################      Encoding    ###################### 

   
8. Charset : it contain a set of characters : they represent the set of all symbols that the end user can display in their browser window. in technical teminology, a charset consists of pairs of symbols and code point. 

9. the symbol is what the user reads as he see on the screen 

10. code point is the numerical index 

11. UTF : Unicode Transformation Format 

12. HTML Entities : is simply a string (starting with & and &# and ending with ; ) that corresponds with a symbol. it will not interpret this as a HTML code. 

13. Base64 : It is a binary to text encoding schema used to convert binary files and send them over internet.  


####################     Same Origin Policy    #################

14. Same Origin Policy : This policy prevent a script or a document from getting or setting properties of another document that comes from different origin. 

15. The Same Origin Policy (SOP) Prevents Javascript, running on a given origin, from interacting with a document from a different origin. The Primary purpose of SOP is to isolate requests coming from different Origin. 

16. the "window.Location" object can be used to get the current page address (URL) and to redirect the browser to a new page.

17. Each Document can write the location propery but cannot read it. This means that the location property can always be changed.

18. location property work when thier is typical relationship : a document is embedded within another via an iframe element, one document is opened by the other via window.open() DOM API.

19. document.domain : This property descibes the domain portion of the origin of the current document.

20. HTML5 feature "Cross Window Messaging" permit different documents(iframes, popups, current window) to communicate with each other regardless of the same origin policy by using a simple synchronous mechanism. 

21. "Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)" : It is a set of specific built to allow a browser to access a few resource by bypassing the SOP 

###################  COOKIES ############### 

22. Cookie Jar : It is the storage space where a web browser store the cookie. 

23. if the server does not specify the domain attribute, the browser will automatically set the domain as the server domain and the cookie "host-only" flag. This means that the cookie will be sent "only to the precise hostname".

24. The "HttpOnly flag" is used to force the browser to send the cookie only through HTTP. this flag prevents the cookie from being read by the javascript , flash, java, and any other HTML technology. This is the protection mechanism against cookie stealing via XSS.

25. The "Secure Flag" force the browser to send the cookie only through HTTPS . This prevent the cookie from being send into clear text. 

26. There are three different cookie Domain : 
	- Specified cookie Domain 
 	- unspecified cookie domain 

27. 1. Cookie Domain value = target Domain
    2. Cookie Domain value different  from target Domain AND Cookie domain value is a suffix of the target Domain. 

28. Security Implication : 
	lower-level Subdomain can set cookies for higer domain. Indeed b.a.elswapt.site can set a cookie for a.elswapt.site or elswapt.site. 
	higer domain cannot set cookies for lower-level subdomains. elswapt.site cannot set cookies for anysubdomain.elswapt.site

29. Unspecified Cookie Domain : When a cookie does not contain a domain value, it is assumed that the "host-only flag" is set to true.

30. Internet Explorer Exception : Cookies with unspecific Domain values will be interpreted by the browser as if they had a domain value corresponfing to the target domain set it in. 

31. HTTP Session are a simple mechanism  that allows website to store variables specifi for a given visit on the server. 

32. The Main Difference between cookie and session id is that cookie is store at the client side whereas the session id is store at the Server side.

##################           INFORMATION GATHERING      #########################	
 
33. use WHOIS database to gather information. 

34. A "Resource Record" starts with a domain name, usually a fully qualified domain name. 
    "Start of Authority" Indicate the beginning of a zone and it should occur first at zone time.
    "Name Server" NS Record are the GLUE that Binds the distributed Database Together. 
    -> A : the "A" record simple maps a hostname to a IP address. Zone with "A" record are called 'Forward' zones
    -> PTR : "pointer" : the "PTR" record maps an IP address to a hostname.zone with PTR record are called 'reverse' zones. 
    -> CNAME : The Cname record maps an alias hostname to an A record hostname.
    -> MX : The MX record specifies a host that will accept emails on behalf of a given host.

35. The nameserver is the DNS server that replies to all lookup queries regarding the namespaces of a Domain.

36. By Using "netcat" we can establish a connection to the web server and look at the server field in the HTTP response header. 

37. "Whatweb" : It is a command Line Tool that can be used to recognize website technologies, Web Server, version, Blogging Platform, JS Libraries etc.

 -------------------- Enumerating Subdomains ------------------------

38. Tools : 1. Netcraft 
	    2. Google (site:.microsoft.com) 
	    3. theharvester
	    4. subbrute
	    5. dnsrecon
	    
39. "TheHarvester" is a tool for gathering subDomain names from different public source such as search engines of PGP key server 

40. Enumerating Subdomain using ZONE TRANSFER

41. "A Zone Transfer is a term used to refer to the process by which the content of the DNS Zone file are copied from Primary DNS Server to Secondary DNS Server."

42. "dig" sis used for Zone Transfer 
	dig @nameserver axfr mudomain.com 
	axfr is a mnemonic opcode for the DNS Zone Tranfer 
	
43. A "Virtual Host" is Simply a website that shares an IP address with one or more other virual Host. 

44.
