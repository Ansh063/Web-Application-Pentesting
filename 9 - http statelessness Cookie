# HTTP is Stateless : 
	
 - Every Request is treated independently 
 - Server does not retain state for clients

 - What dows this mean ? 
	Every request need to be separately authenticated
	Every Request Must carry auth information 
 
# Cookies : 

 - Allows Server to store and retrieve data from the client 
 - typically store in a file on the client side
 - Text Only, No executable code
 - cannot exceed 4K in size
 - Allows for Retaining State with the Client's help 
	- Session Management 
	- User Preference 

How is cookie set by the server ?? 

 - You can filter the with "http.set_cookie" in wireshark
 - And the variable name is "Set-Cookie"
 
Eg. sessionID=ahj23dfghjtyuicvb

 - multiple seperated by : 
	-E.g. Name=Ansh;Age=12;Country=India

 - Session Cookie if "expires" not mentioned 
 - Format : 
	- DAY, DD-MMM-YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT
	- Mon, 22-Nov-2013 22:45:00 GMT
 - Max-Age Parameter in newer RFC 6265
	- Interval in seconds after receiving the cookie

Cookie : Domain -> 
 
 - This is the Domain or Sub Domain for which the cookie is valid and should be used : 
 eg.	- docs.securitytube.net
	- .images.securitytube.net 
   
Cookie : Path ->

 - Path can dictate when certain cookie be sent and not 
 eg.    - Sid1=asd; Path=/;
	
Cookie : Secure ->

 - This means that this cookie will only be sent on HTTPS

Cookie : httponly -> 

 - cannot be accessed by Client side Script directly 
 - cannot be scripted using javascript 
 - XSS mitigation mechanism
