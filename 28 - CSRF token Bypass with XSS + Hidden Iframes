CSRF Token Bypass with Xss + Hidden Iframe : 


Does the User Really have to visit the Real Website ? 

 - Very Noisy ! User could suspect something 
 - Easy to lure user to attacker controlled website 
 - Can we leverage the discovered XSS there ? 

Iframe : 

 - An Iframe is used to display a web page within a web page 
	- All Original Policies apply within the frame
 - Hidden frame 
	- Hide the frame from view entirely!!

To hide a iframe user
	
	 style="display:none"


What the Attacker CAN/CANNOT do 

CAN : 
  - use XSS to run payload 
  - Payload can post to attacker's website 

CANNOT : 
  - Read Data directly from the embedded frame 
  - Not required in most case
