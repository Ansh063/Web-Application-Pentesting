Most of the Web Browser are not vulnerable to HTTP verb Tampering 
HTTP Verb Tampering is an attack that exploits vulnerabilities in HTTP verb (also known as HTTP method) authentication and 
access control mechanisms. Many authentication mechanisms only limit access to the most common HTTP methods, thus allowing 
unauthorized access to restricted resources by other HTTP methods.

NOTE : Because HTTP Verb Tampering typically ends up happening because of misconfiguration 

One of the possible way that this can happen 

1. .htaccess Misconfiguration 
	
example : 
	AuthType Basic
	AuthName "Restricted Files"	
	AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/passwords
	
	<Limit POST>
	Require valid-user
	</Limit>

Limit access to this resource (valid-user) only by a POST unfortunately this also interpret as that any other
request method  would end up becoming valid and Does not require any form of authentication 
This will lead to HTTP verb Tampering
