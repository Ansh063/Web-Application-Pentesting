SSL - Transport Layer Protection : 

HTTP : 
 
 - HTTP is Plain Text 
 - Eavesdropping on a connection 
 - use of insecure Wi-fi at coffee shops, airports  most common example
 - Credentials Stolen : 
	- Username + Password
	- Cookies and Session ID

HTTPS : 

 - Transport Layer Protection 
 - Create an encrypted tunnel first and send data through it 
 - Typically port 443

How do we peer into a HTTPS Connection ?? 

 - Have access to private key for decryption 
 - MITM attack with self signed certificate
 - Tools like SSLStrip to force https to http

 NOTE : Burp already has created it's own self signed certificate which it will used to help you peer into 
	HTTPS connection.
